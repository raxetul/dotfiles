# Global agent rules

These apply across every project on this machine, on top of any
repo-local `CLAUDE.md` and the organization instructions. When a
repo-local rule or the organization instructions conflict with
something here, those win.

## Adding rules: prefer project-scoped commands

Keep this global file small — it loads into every session. When I ask
for something to be "added to global", first **offer a project-specific
mechanism**: a slash command that writes the rule into an individual
project's `CLAUDE.md` on demand, rather than growing this always-loaded
file. The `/backend-stack` command (pins a project's backend framework
by language) is the reference pattern. Only put a rule here when it
genuinely must apply everywhere.
